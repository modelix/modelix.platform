:navtitle: modelix.platform

The modelix platform is a Gradle platform built using https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_platform_plugin.html[Gradle's Java Platform Plugin].
It aggregates the versions of individual modelix components.
Furthermore, the platform simplifies versioning by mapping the modelix release version to the versions of the individual components.
These are curated for each release so that compatibility between them is ensured.
